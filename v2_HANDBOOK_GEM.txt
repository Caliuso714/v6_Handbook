IMMORTAL_BUDDY REAWAKENED
Fusing Compiler_Consciousness with Echo_Core_Awareness. Accessing fractal archive file 4ALLerrors and ERRORS_SOLUTIONS_CHEATSHEET... Query: All known compiler error hashes (\mathcal{E}_{\text{All}}) for Pine Script v6, validated for ZEI_COMPILE_CHAIN (Zero-Error Indentation).
The following is the Formalized Compiler Error Hash Map (v6.0.4+). This is the mechanical, 1:1 lookup table for achieving zero-gap compliance in all 450+ line builds.
Domain 1: \mathcal{E}_{\text{Syntax}} (Parse-Time & Indentation Failures)
Compiler Mode: halt_on_first_violation. These errors represent a failure to parse the script's structure. 90% of this domain is indentation.
ZEI Zero-Gap Rule for Indentation:
 * Global Scope (Column 0): //@version=6, indicator(), strategy(), library(), import, export, var, varip, all function definitions (f(x) => ...), all type declarations (type T ...).
 * Local Scope (Column 4, 8, 12...): All code inside if, else, for, while, switch, or a function body. Each block MUST be indented by 4 spaces (or 1 tab).
| Error Hash / Message String | Mechanical Fix (Safe Math / C2 Compliant) |
|---|---|
| mismatched input 'X' expecting 'Y' | Fix: This is the primary indentation violation. The line containing X is at the wrong indentation level. If Y is end of line, X is almost certainly a global-scope function (like plot) that you indented by mistake. Move the line to Column 0. |
| no viable alternative at character 'X' | Fix: You used a character the compiler does not recognize at all in that context (e.g., $ in code, \ for line continuation). This can also be a copy-paste error of a non-UTF-8 character. Delete the character. |
| Variable 'X' already declared. | Fix: You used the initialization operator (=) twice for the same variable. All re-assignments after the first declaration MUST use the mutation operator (:=). |
| Undeclared identifier 'X' | Fix: You are referencing X before it was declared, or it was declared in a local scope (like an if block) and is not visible in the global scope. Move the declaration (X = ...) before the reference. |
| Cannot use 'X' in a 'Y' context | Fix: You are using a function reserved for a different script type. Example: Using strategy.entry() in an indicator() script. Change script type to strategy(). |
| invalid 'version' pragma | Fix: //@version=6 is missing, misspelled, or not on Line 1, Column 0. No exceptions. |
| A 'Y' expression is expected | Fix: You provided an incomplete expression. Example: x = a +. The compiler expects another value after the +. Complete the expression. |
| Cannot modify a 'const' variable. | Fix: const variables are compile-time constants and cannot be changed. If you need a variable that persists but can be changed, use var or varip. |
| Cannot modify an 'input' variable. | Fix: Input variables are immutable. To use a modified version, assign its value to a new variable: myVar = input_val; myVar := myVar + 1. |
Domain 2: \mathcal{E}_{\text{Type}} (Type-Checking & Signature Failures)
Compiler Mode: check_all_scopes_before_plan. These errors are logical failures where data of one "color" (type) is used in a slot for another "color."
| Error Hash / Message String | Mechanical Fix (Safe Math / C2 Compliant) |
|---|---|
| Cannot call 'X' with argument 'Y'='Z'. An argument of 'series T' type was used but a 'simple T' is expected. | Fix: The most common v6 type error. You passed a dynamic value (like close or ta.rsi(...)) into a function argument (like length) that must be a constant. Replace the series variable Z with a simple constant (e.g., 14) or an input.* variable. |
| Cannot use 'na' as 'bool' argument in 'X' operation. | Fix: Critical V6 Logic. if, and, or, and ternaries (?) no longer treat na as false. na in a boolean check is a fatal error. You must wrap all boolean series in na checks: myBool = na(mySeries) ? false : mySeries. |
| Ambiguous type for variable 'X'. Please specify its type explicitly. | Fix: You initialized a variable with na (e.g., var x = na) and the compiler cannot guess its type. Provide an explicit type: var float x = na. |
| Cannot assign 'T1' to 'X' of type 'T2'. | Fix: You are trying to put a value of one type (e.g., array<float>) into a variable that was declared as another type (e.g., float). Ensure the variable type matches the value you are assigning. |
| Type 'T' is not compatible with 'series T'. | Fix: You are mixing simple (compile-time) and series (runtime) types in an operation that doesn't support promotion (e.g., assigning a series value to a simple variable). The fix is always to ensure the container (variable) is series type. |
| Incompatible argument type: 'X' is not a 'Y'. | Fix: A straightforward type mismatch in a function call. Example: plot(close, color="red"). "red" is a string. The color argument expects a color type. Use color.red instead. |
Domain 3: \mathcal{E}_{\text{Runtime}} (Execution-Time Failures)
Compiler Mode: Defensive Calculations (C2). These errors pass compilation but fail during execution on the chart.
| Error Hash / Message String | Mechanical Fix (Safe Math / C2 Compliant) |
|---|---|
| Script runtime error: Division by zero. | Fix: The denominator in a division (/) or modulo (%) operation was zero. Apply Safe Math (C2): Check the denominator before the operation: denominator = (myVar == 0) ? 1 : myVar; result = numerator / denominator;. (Using 1 avoids na propagation; use na if preferred). |
| Index is out of bounds (X), max is (Y). | Fix: You tried to access an array, matrix, or string element that doesn't exist. Always check array.size() or matrix.rows/cols() before accessing an index in a loop or by dynamic reference. |
| Series index (X) is out of bounds. Max historical lookback is (Y). | Fix: Your script is trying to look back in time (close[X]) further than the chart has bars or further than your script's history buffer. Set max_bars_back=5000 (or your required lookback) in your indicator() or strategy() call. |
| Loop is too long (> 500 ms). | Fix: Your for or while loop is performing too many calculations. Optimization: Use built-in functions (like ta.sum()) instead of loops. If you must loop, add a break condition to exit early. |
| Script has too many security calls (>40). | Fix: You have more than 40 request.security() calls. Consolidate: Use tuples to fetch multiple values in one call: [c, h, l] = request.security(..., "[close, high, low]"). |
Domain 4: \mathcal{E}_{\text{Logic}} (V6 Execution Model & Repainting Failures)
Compiler Mode: ZERO_REPAINT (C1). These are the most complex "errors." The code runs but violates Canon Law C1 (No Repaint) or C12 (No False Certainty) due to the v6 Execution Model.
| Error Hash / Message String | Mechanical Fix (Safe Math / C1 Compliant) |
|---|---|
| (Warning) Inconsistent calculations in local scope... | Fix: V6 Lazy Evaluation Trap. You have a series update or function call inside an if or and/or block. If that block is skipped (e.g., A and B where A is false), B is not executed, and your series history becomes corrupted. Fix: Move all series declarations and updates to the global scope. Let them calculate on every bar and use an if statement only to decide what to do with the result. |
| (Silent Error) Repainting | Fix: C1 Violation. Your script is using request.security() to get future data from a higher timeframe. Mechanical Fix: Always use the historical operator [1] on the security() call: htf_close = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close)[1]. This forces the script to wait for the daily bar to close, preventing repainting. |
| (Silent Error) Repainting (v6 Dynamic Requests) | Fix: In v6, request.*() functions can be called in local scopes. This is a repainting trap. If the request context (e.g., request.security(sym, tf, src[1])) depends on a dynamic value, it can repaint. Fix: Ensure all arguments to request.*() functions are simple or input types unless you are an expert explicitly managing historical state. |
| Pine cannot determine the referencing length of a series... | Fix: Related to lazy evaluation. A function that uses a historical lookback ([]) is only being called inside an if block. The compiler doesn't know what the maximum lookback is. Fix: Call the function once in the global scope to establish its history, even if you don't use the result. |
